“20 MW Capacity Biomass based Power Project of M/s. SHALIVAHANA GREEN ENERGY LIMITED” Version 1.0
___
The project 20 MW Capacity Biomass based Power Project of M/s. SHALIVAHANA GREEN ENERGY
LIMITED is located in Village : Nimdha.: Taluk & Dist : Dhenkanal, State: Orissa, and Country India.

Purpose of the project activity:
M/s. SHALIVAHANA GREEN ENERGY LIMITED (SGEL) is establishing a green field biomass based
power plant of capacity 20 MW which supplies electricity only to grid system. The power plant constitutes
a Bubbling Fluidised Bed Combustion (BFBC) boiler which will use surplus biomass residues available
in the region like paddy stalks, ground nut shell, stalks of red grams, mung, til, maize etc. agro industrial
waste (rice husk) and woody biomass (juliflora & casuarina twigs, etc) from agricultural/waste lands. The
electricity generated from the project activity will be supplied to the grid system owned by Orissa Power
Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL), a state utility which is part of NEWNE grid. The project
activity envisages to install 20 MW biomass based power plant. The project activity is installing a BFBC
(Bubbling Fluidised Bed Combustion) boiler with high temperature and pressure parameters that can take
multi-fuels to generate steam to drive the turbo- generator. The generation of electricity is achieved
through sustainable means without causing any negative impact on the environment and contributes to
climate change mitigation. The biomass fuel is considered as carbon neutral in nature and the electricity
generation from the project activity is a clean form of energy.
The project activity utilizes renewable biomass residues for power generation, through Rankine cycle of
direct combustion (technology) of biomass residues, since, the biomass fuel is considered as carbon
neutral in nature, the electricity generation from the project activity is considered as a clean form of
energy. The project activity exports the generated electricity to the carbon intensive NEWNE region grid
that is highly dominated by thermal energy sources; thereby it reduces the equivalent amount of emissions
in to the atmosphere. The project activity would protect and conserve the local environment by avoiding
unintended emissions from the decay and uncontrolled burning of biomass, which is a common practice
in the region.

### PRIOR HISTORY

PP has never taken any issuance fromt he CDM or VERRA during the cuurent UCR crediting period as no CDM/VCS verification has been done
___________________

SECTORAL SCOPE: 01, Energy industries (Renewable/Non-renewable sources)
TYPE: I - Renewable Energy Projects
CATEGORY: ACM0018. (Title: “Electricity generation from biomass in power-only plants”, version 06)
Note: PP had applied the version 10 of the methodology as the project is a CDM and VCS registered
project under the CDM1 with the version 1.3 of the applied methodology. The project was registered at
CDM on 18/07/2012 with first crediting period of 10 years (from 18/07/2012 – 17/07/2022 (Fixed)).

___________
VERRA ID: 2047

VCS Crediting Period:18/07/2012 - 17/07/2022
But PP has never taken any issuance during the crediting period as no verification has been done. Hence,
for UCR registration the latest version of methodology i.e., version 06 is being considered for emission
reduction calculation which is also the current version applied under CDM & VCS.
